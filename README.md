# Scripts
ansible playooks

inventry file - file which stores IP address of target server

ansible adhoc commands
module (-m) and arguments (-a) in ansible
ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a touch "devopsclass"

ansible adhoc (for 1 or 2 tasks) command vs playbook (for multiple tasks)

how do you group the servers in ansible? (can be done in inventory file)
